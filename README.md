# spatial-conf

A modified spatial configuration Houdini project for the Architecture minor. 

Main differences to the original (which this repository is based on, credits to staff of the course BK7083):
* Function connectivity only depends on the adjacency matrix (as opposed to a separate column defining the connections)
* Alignment of the functions in three dimensions
